## How to Use

### On a Chapter Page (`mangadex.org/chapter/...`)

1.  Navigate to any manga chapter on MangaDex.
2.  Click the extension icon in your toolbar.
3.  Click the **"Download Current Chapter"** button. The chapter will be downloaded in the format specified in your settings.

### On a Manga Title Page (`mangadex.org/title/...`)

1.  Navigate to the main page for any manga series.
2.  Click the extension icon.
3.  Use the **language dropdown** to filter the chapter list.
4.  **Check the boxes** next to the chapters you wish to download.
5.  Click the **"Download Selected"** button. The chapters will be added to a queue and downloaded in the background.

## Settings

Click the **"Settings"** tab in the extension popup to configure the following options:

-   **Download As:** Choose the format for your downloads:
    -   `Images`: Saves each page as a separate image file (e.g., .png).
    -   `ZIP`: Compresses the entire chapter into a single `.zip` file.
    -   `PDF`: Compiles all chapter pages into a single `.pdf` document.
-   **Concurrent Chapters:** The number of chapters to process simultaneously (default: 3).
-   **Concurrent Images:** The number of images to download at the same time (for `Images` mode only, default: 5).
-   **Retry Count:** How many times to retry a failed image download (default: 3).
-   **Retry Delay (ms):** The wait time in milliseconds before a retry attempt (default: 1000).
-   **Stability Checks:** The number of 250ms intervals the page must be stable before starting a download. Increase this if chapters are not fully loading.
-   **Overall Timeout (s):** The maximum time to wait for a chapter's images to load.

Remember to click **"Save Settings"** after making any changes.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Incomplete downloads or "No images found":** Try increasing the "Stability Checks" and "Overall Timeout (s)" values in the settings. This is often necessary for very long chapters or on slower connections.
-   **Browser blocking downloads:** The extension may trigger your browser's protection against downloading multiple files at once. If prompted, always choose to "Allow" the downloads.
-   **Extension not working:** Ensure you are on a valid `mangadex.org` chapter or title page and reload the page.
